### Description

This year TPSA is collaborating with IBM Quantum for the Qiskit Fall Fest. Participants in the Fall Fest will have the chance to complete 3 educational, tutorial style coding labs given by IBM in their quantum software Qiskit and get to learn about one of the fastest growing fields in physics, and obtain skills in quantum physics, Python and other areas which will be helpful in the future.
The Qiskit Fall Fest will be held from October 30th to November 10th during which participants will not only complete the labs, but can attend a talk from a member of the IBM Quantum team in Dublin and get to hear about some of the most prevalent problems in quantum information research.
All participants in the Fall Fest will get a certificate of participation(which will look good in applications for internships and postgraduate study) and anyone who successfully completes all labs will also get a certificate of achievement.
Anyone who wishes to participate is welcome!
